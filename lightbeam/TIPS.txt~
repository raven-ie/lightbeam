-Use small images for particles.
-Picking can be expensive. Try to find intersection only with few objects.
-Don't check collisions between all objects. O(n^2)
-The textures and shaders less the better because less switching between them. (each switch is expensive)
-Set entity visibility to false is last thing what you should do.
-You shouldn't work with obj model files. Convert them into .mesh files.
